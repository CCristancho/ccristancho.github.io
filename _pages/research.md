## 1. Protest and Collective Action

### 1.1 Individual Behavior

Research explores:
- Participation in protests and demonstrations
- Social media’s impact on mobilization and inequality
- Online/offline coordination and organization-independent collective action

**Methodological Strategies**:
- **News Coverage Experiments**: Causal analysis of journalist perceptions (w/ Ruud Wouters, 2021)
- **Elite Reactions & Media Frames**: Twitter-based study on Catalan nationalism (w/ Silvia Majò, Eva Anduiza)
- **Spatial Inequalities in Protest Supply**: Geo-located protest dataset in Barcelona (w/ Sheila González)
- **15M/Indignados Movement**: Surveys and text analysis of protest networks and connective action (w/ Eva Anduiza)

### 1.2 Elite Emotions and Catalan Independence

- Twitter-based study of how elite messages shape emotional reactions among followers during the Catalan independence process.

### 1.3 Identity Formation and Media Claims

- Network analysis of protester claims in pro-Palestinian demonstrations worldwide (w/ Elena Pavan).

## 2. Public Support for Protest

- Combines surveys, experiments, LLMs, and text analysis.
- Early studies: Twitter data and media frame analysis.
- Comparative survey in 9 European countries during the 2010 crisis (w/ Katrin Uba, Lorenzo Zamponi).
- New work on synthetic data generation using large language models (w/ Eva Anduiza, Marco Giugni, Katrin Uba).

## 3. Media Representations of Protest

Focuses on Latin America using a 25-year, 18,000-item protest dataset.

- Incorporates social psychology to explore media narratives, system justification, and majority status.
- Future extensions:
  1. Experiments measuring media effects and psychological mechanisms
  2. Algorithmic representations on YouTube using bot simulations and personalization models

## 4. Influence and Response of Political Elites to Interest Groups

Part of a 3-year PI-led project: **Rhetorical representation and influence in policy making** (RTI2018-100861-J-I00).

- Original dataset includes 2000–2020 records from press releases, social media, government agendas, and parliamentary debates.
- Published work on:
  - Influence in emergency contexts
  - Cultural outcomes of women’s organizations
  - Rhetorical adoption of interest group narratives (under review)
  - Methodological framework using computational linguistics

## 5. Public Perceptions of Interest Representation

(In collaboration with Leire Rincón)

- Uses survey experiments to assess public views on the legitimacy and effectiveness of lobbying efforts.
- Focus on the role of **public support** in interest group success.

---

## 6. Interest Groups in Parliament

(In collaboration with Luz Muñoz and Anna Palau)

- Uses text and network science to analyze:
  - Interactions between 1,491 interest groups and 25 parliamentary parties
  - Based on 6,500 hearings from the Spanish **Congreso de los Diputados** (1996–2023)

---

## 7. Agenda Dynamics and Political Representation

(In collaboration with Laura Chaqués, Emanuella Lombardo, Emiliano Grossman, et al.)

- Gender and issue representation in parliaments
- Linguistic differences between male/female MPs
- Comparison of agenda attention between social media and institutional debates
- Uses mixed-method and classifier performance analyses

---

## 8. Presidential Agendas in Latin America

- Original dataset of 30,000 speeches (formal and media-based) from 8 countries (20 years)
- Policy issue classification at sentence level
- Ideological classification using a synthetic dataset of 1,800 left/right claims

---

## 9. Methodological Innovation

Highlights innovations in computational linguistics, network science, and synthetic data:

1. **Frame Identification Dataset**  
   - 2M tweets/news items on Indignados Movement (2011–2013)

2. **Protest Event Datasets**  
   - From human-annotated Barcelona dataset (2010–2015) to LLM-based extraction for Europe & Latin America

3. **Measuring Influence via Linguistic Similarity**  
   - Dataset of 150 groups: 1M tweets, press releases, hearings

4. **Classifying Tweets into Policy Issues**  
   - Applied to celebrities, government Twitter, Latin American agendas, Colombia’s peace agreement

5. **Cultural Outcomes of Movements**  
   - NLP analysis of manifestos; comparative EU project proposal and DIPROMATS 2024 paper (w/ José Antonio García-Díaz)

6. **LLMs as Survey Surrogates**  
   - Evaluating protest attitudes (w/ Katrin Uba, under review in *Sociological Methods & Research*, 2025)

7. **Agentic Interest Groups Simulation**  
   - LLM-based policy actor simulations for classroom use (UB 2025, teaching innovation)
