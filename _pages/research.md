## Protest and collective action

### Individual behavior

Research on individual participation in protests, demonstrations, and the role of social media in mobilization and inequality.

**Methodological Strategies:**

- **News Coverage Experiments**  
  With Ruud Wouters (2021): Two conjoint experiments with journalists to examine how protest attributes affect media coverage.

- **Elite Reactions & Media Frames**  
  With Silvia Majò and Eva Anduiza: Uses Twitter data to study elite-public interactions during anti-austerity and Catalan nationalist protests.

- **Spatial Inequalities in Protest**  
  With Sheila González: Combines survey data and a geo-located protest dataset in Barcelona to study protest supply.

- **15M/Indignados Movement**  
  With Eva Anduiza: Surveys and text analysis to study connective action and participant profiles in the Spanish anti-austerity movement.

### Elite emotions and catalan independence

Twitter-based analysis of how political elite claims shaped emotional responses during the Catalan independence and counter-movements.

### Identity formation and media claims

With Elena Pavan: Network science applied to demonstrator narratives in pro-Palestinian protests across time and space.

## Public support for protest

Combines survey data, experiments, LLMs, and text analysis:

- Early work: Twitter analyses of protest events in Spain.
- Framing effects in news and social media on public support.
- Comparative survey in 9 European countries during the 2010 economic crisis (with Katrin Uba and Lorenzo Zamponi).
- Latest research explores synthetic data with large language models (Uba, Anduiza, Giugni).

## Media representations of protest

Focus on Latin America, using a dataset of 18,000 protest newswire stories (1999–2024):

- Analyzes narrative framing through the lens of social psychology (e.g., system justification, majority status).
- Future work includes:
  1. Experimental designs testing individual perception of protest media.
  2. Algorithmic bias on YouTube via bot-based user simulations.

## Influence and response of political elites to interest groups

From PI-led project: **RTI2018-100861-J-I00 (2019–2022)**

- Tracks rhetorical and agenda influence using datasets covering 2000–2020:
  - Press releases
  - Social media
  - Parliamentary transcripts

Published and in-progress work:
- Influence in emergencies
- Cultural outcomes of women’s orgs
- Narrative adoption by elites (under review)
- Methodological paper on rhetorical influence measurement

## Public perceptions of interest representation

With Leire Rincón:

- Explores how lobbying success is tied to public approval.
- Uses survey experiments with a nationally representative sample.
- Studies effects of tactics, contact, and issue salience.

---

## Interest groups in parliament

With Luz Muñoz and Anna Palau:

- Network and text analysis of 6,500 parliamentary hearings (1996–2023)
- Maps interaction between 1,491 interest groups and 25 parliamentary parties in Spain’s Congreso.

---

## Agenda dynamics and political representation

With Laura Chaqués, Emanuella Lombardo, Emiliano Grossman, et al.

- Shows female MPs are marginalized in parliamentary discourse (EJPR, 2022).
- Mixed-method study of gendered language and issue attention.
- Recent work explores:
  - Classifier performance across MP speeches (France, Italy, Spain)
  - Differences in agenda attention between social media vs parliament (under review)

---

## Presidential agendas in latin america

Original dataset of 30,000 presidential speeches (2000–2024):

- Includes institutional addresses and personal media programs.
- Sentence-level classification of:
  - Policy issues
  - Ideological position (based on synthetic left/right dataset)

## Methodological innovation

1. **Frame identification**  
   - Supervised approach using 2M tweets/news items from 2011–2013 Indignados protests (with Silvia Majò-Vázquez)

2. **Protest event extraction**  
   - Transitioned from human-annotated Barcelona dataset to LLM-based event extraction for Europe & Latin America

3. **Linguistic influence measurement**  
   - Compares similarity across tweets, hearings, press releases for 150 organizations

4. **Tweet classification into policy issues**  
   - Supervised classifier using celebrity/government Twitter to identify topics; applied to Latin America and Colombia

5. **Cultural outcomes of movements**  
   - NLP on manifestos and narratives; published in *Participation and Conflict* (2021); DIPROMATS challenge (2024)

6. **LLMs as survey surrogates**  
   - Evaluates attitudes toward protest via LLMs; under review in *Sociological Methods & Research* (2025, with Katrin Uba)

7. **Agentic interest groups (simulations)**  
   - Uses generative AI in policy actor role-play for teaching (UB 2025); paper on teaching innovation in progress
